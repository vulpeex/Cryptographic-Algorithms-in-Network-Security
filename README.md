# Cryptographic-Algorithms-in-Network-Security
Manually implemented cryptographic algorithms in Python, developed as part of my academic assignments and independent study at IIT Delhi.  This repository contains foundational cryptographic schemes implemented without reliance on external libraries, focusing on conceptual clarity and algorithmic depth including:


- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** : Symmetric encryption using substitution-permutation networks

- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** : Public-key encryption with modular arithmetic and key generation

- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** :  Lightweight asymmetric encryption over elliptic curves, including image encryption demonstrations

- **Image Encryption Demonstrations** : Practical applications of AES, RSA and ECC in securely encrypting visual data

Also planning to add other conceptual codes and diagrams I've written for Hash Functions, MACs and Key Distribution.
